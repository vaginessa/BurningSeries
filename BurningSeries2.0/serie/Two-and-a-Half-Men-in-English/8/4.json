         "description":"Alan, Lindsey, Jake and Eldridge are staying with Charlie. Lindsey is so upset that Alan burnt her house down and takes every opportunity to remind Alan what he did. Charlie goes to check out the burnt down house and accidentally leaves his cell phone there. When he goes back to get his phone he finds Herb there along with Gordon, the pizza guy. Lindsey?s ex-husband Chris (Judd Nelson) shows up to reminisce about the house.  A men?s group is formed as they start discussing women and marriage (just like they did in ?The two finger rule?). Lindsey shows up at the burnt down house and calls Alan on the phone to let him know that she forgives him but ends up leaving with her ex-husband Chris.",
