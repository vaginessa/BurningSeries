Eventually Charlie turns to his therapist Dr. Freeman (Jane Lynch) and she tells him that instead of picking up women he needs to go out and meet friends. Charlie goes to Pavlov?s hoping to meet some people he can be friends with. Alan is there and they begin to talk. In the end they realize they truly are each other?s best friend.",
