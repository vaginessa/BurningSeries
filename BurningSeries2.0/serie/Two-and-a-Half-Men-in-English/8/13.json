Alan forbids Lindsey from inviting Charlie to her housewarming party (renovated after Alan burnt it down) and she kicks Alan out. With everyone at the party Alan hides outside and spies on Charlie and Lindsey to see if his theory is true. While doing so he gets sprayed by a skunk and steps on dog crap. He runs to Judith?s house where Herb tells him to pour katsup on himself in an attempt to get rid of the skunk smell.",
